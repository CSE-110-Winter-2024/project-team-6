Calculation of Iteration 1's Velocity and applied to I2's Planning

Calculation of Iteration 1's velocity: There were 30 hours of work to be done and we expended roughly 70 hours (11-12 hours per person) so our velocity was 3/7 = 0.43. Our velocity was higher than anticipated and this was likely because we are more familiar with each other and can collaborate more effectively and efficiently. Its also because of the experience we accumulated working on MS1. 

Velocity Estimate for Iteration 2: 0.43. Using the calculation for iteration 1's velocity we applied it to iteration 2 as we believed that our rate of work during iteration 1 was very smooth, productive and sustainable. As such, the velocity should roughly remain the same. We felt confident about this estimate also because of the experience we accumulated working on the first iteration.
